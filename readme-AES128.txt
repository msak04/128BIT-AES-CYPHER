Please Keep A file named java AES_Cipher filename.txt which contains plain text in the same project folder.
Then only run the project and provide a 16 letter key. It will find the file automatically. If there is more 
than one file with the same starting prefix (java AES_Cipher), it will automatically pick the first one according
